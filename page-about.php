                <p>
                The Pyrates Confraternity was formed in 1952 by seven undergraduates of the University College, Ibadan in response to the prevailing predisposition, at the time, of notions of class privilege, elitism and indifference to the social realities of the nation, Nigeria, especially by students of middle class upbringing, scions of business tycoons and colonial aristocracy. At that time, the University College, Ibadan was the premier institution of higher learning in Nigeria and a prominent replication of all that was undesirable about the colonised Nigeria. Amidst this were a handful of students from poorer backgrounds who either stuck doggedly to their books, looking forward to the day when the prize of an academic degree would compensate their present indignities, or strove assiduously to be admitted to the sophisticated circle of their flashier peers. So it was that the Pyrates Confraternity was conceived as an organisational response to the eradication of those various forms of institutional decadence that pervaded the students’ environment at the time. It envisioned philosophies that were entirely non-conformist to the moribund conventional practices that fueled these tendencies and was intended to develop as a movement to resist the continuing negative growth prevalent in elitist, middle class Nigeria. It was against this background and to combat these negative tendencies that these seven students founded the Pyrates Confraternity (PC). The original founding fathers, otherwise known as the <strong>Original Seven</strong>, are: 1. Wole Soyinka 2. Ralph Opara 3. Pius Oleghe 4. Ikpehare Aig-Imoukhuede 5. Nathaniel Oyelola 6. Olumuyiwa Awe 7. Sylvanus U. Egbuche

                The names that appear beside these great names are their pyratical names, a concept that is at the very root of the accomplishment of organisational objectives. Explained simply, tribalism and nepotism in Nigeria, at the time and now, facilitated by easy identification associated with names from various tribes. To ensure the disappearance of tribal identity as a source of identification, everyone who joins the organization is given a name from which it is impossible to discern either tribal or even national identity. This practice also applied to places where the organization developed a presence.

                <h4>Evolution of the Pyrates Confraternity</h4>
                From the pioneering base of University of Ibadan, the philosophies and movement grew and was exported to other institutions of higher learning that were emerging. The attraction to its objectives and accomplishments was such that it was to grow exponentially. By 1978, there were a total of 18 branches with thousands of members having passed through membership. The unique feature was that these members were or had passed through various universities in Nigeria at the time. On 31 October 1980 the organisation was formally registered with the Nigerian Federal Ministry of Internal Affairs under the Land (Perpetual Succession) Act Cap 98 with the name “National Association of Seadogs” RC No 1592. The variation in the original name was to reflect both the larger national outlook and incorporate an essential ingredient of the concept of seadogs as part of the visible identity. However, by the early 1970s, unsavory behavior of several imitator organizations began to emerge from the various campuses. Although they claimed to be fraternities, their behavior became so disturbing that, on 28 July 1984, in order to protect its integrity, NAS closed down all in-campus, student branches of the organization. The process of entry into the organization was realigned and streamlined over the years. For the past 15 years, new members, in country, are now derived only from university graduates who have completed national service under the National Youth Service Scheme.

                <h4>NAS in the 21st Century</h4>
                Today, NAS has evolved from a campus confraternity to a community focused, advocacy organisation with 60 branches spread across Nigeria, South Africa, Europe, Asia, America and Canada. In addition to its other activities, it remains dedicated to social advocacy, humanitarian and charitable endeavours within and outside Nigeria or whatever society in which the members find themselves. The organisation has placed at the disposal of the society, its huge professional membership in virtually all areas of professional endeavour. Its membership can be found in various aspects of societal life within and outside Nigeria including the government and the private sector. Its willingness to help society reconstruct and to build is, and remains, an asset which society can and has been freely exploiting.

                The maritime theme (inspired by Robert Louis Stevenson’s classic ”Treasure Island”) is reflected in the organisational structure in which branches of NAS are referred to as Decks. They are known both by the town or city of location and an informal name such as ‘Jolly Rogers 1’. The various decks are grouped into areas where necessary.
                <br>

                The headquarters of NAS International, and NAS are in Nigeria. All decks have a number of officers who carry out the administrative and other functions. The highest office is that of the Captain or Capoon, and his deputy is the First Mate. Other officers fulfill the typical functions that such an organisation needs such as looking after finances, public relations, social activities and so forth. In addition, there is a central NAS executive which administers NAS and NAS International.
                <br>

                The organisation is hierarchical and operates a strict discipline based on the understanding that the organisation has an altruistic mission which must be carried out. Members have to place personal convenience secondary to achieving the aims of the organisation and much stock is placed on members carrying out duties delegated to them. Failure to partake fully in organisational projects and discharge duties assigned can result in membership being suspended.

                <h4>Branches of NAS in Nigeria</h4>

                <h4>Branches of NAS outside Nigeria</h4>

                <h3>Skull & X-Bones</h3>
                <p>
                The logo of the confraternity, coloured in red, black and yellow, is the skull positioned between two crossbones. To the ordinary undiscerning observer, it smells of danger. Thus was the perception of members as men of danger.

                The logo was the deliberate choice of the Original Seven. Its real essence is to serve as a constant reminder to all members and those on whom they might impact of what all will be reduced to in the final analysis.

                The lesson is “While in body, flesh and spirit, do whatever you can now for the sake of humanity”. In the end, skulls and bones will not be differentiated. It is what we do and who we become that we all will be remembered by till eternity long after the bones and skulls are reduced to dust and ashes.

                The words “Odas is Odas”, which simply translate Orders is Orders echos the watchword of the organisation, that is , “DISCIPLINE”.
