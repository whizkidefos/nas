                    The Pyrates Confraternity was formed in 1952 by seven undergraduates of the University College, Ibadan in response to the prevailing predisposition, at the time, of notions of class privilege, elitism and indifference to the social realities of the nation, Nigeria, especially by students of middle class upbringing, scions of business tycoons and colonial aristocracy. The Pyrates Confraternity was founded to fight against societal ills and promote the welfare of the Nigerian people.
